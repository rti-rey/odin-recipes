    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
        Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
        Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
        Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
        Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
        Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
        Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
        Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
        Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
